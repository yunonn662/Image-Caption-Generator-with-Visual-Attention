# Image-Caption-Generator-with-Visual-Attention
This is my Data Science Project/Final Year Project for my Third Year 1st Semester in University of Malaya.
## Objectives:
1. To model Context-Aware Image Captioning: Improve the contextual understanding of images by incorporating the encoder-decoder architecture. This architecture will capture relationships between the visual content and textual descriptions, leading to the generation of more coherent and context-aware image captions.
2. To implement an Attention Mechanism into the Model: Develop and integrate different visual attention mechanism and into the image captioning model, allowing it to focus on relevant image regions during
the caption generation process.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface to allow users to upload images and receive detailed and meaningful captions. The interface will serve as a practical application of the modelâ€™s capabilities, benefiting users in various domains, including accessibility services and content enrichment
